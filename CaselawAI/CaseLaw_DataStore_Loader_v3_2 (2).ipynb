BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. Alyce Conlon worked at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (\\u201cIVCF\\u201d) in Michigan as a spiritual director, involved in providing religious counsel and prayer. She informed IVCF that she was contemplating divorce, at which point IVCF put her on paid \\u2014 and later unpaid \\u2014 leave. When her marital situation continued to worsen despite counseling efforts, IVCF terminated her employment. Conlon sued IVCF and her supervisors in federal district court under Title VII and Michigan law. IVCF claimed the First Amendment\\u2019s ministerial exception to employment laws. The court dismissed the case, holding the ministerial exception bars all of Conlon\\u2019s claims. We AFFIRM. I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (\\u201cIVCF\\u201d) is \\u201can evangelical campus mission serving students and faculty on college and university campuses nationwide,\\u201d whose \\u201cvision is to see students and faculty transformed, campuses renewed and world changers developed.\\u201d IVCF\\u2019s purpose \\u201cis to establish and advance at colleges and universities witnessing communities of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord: growing in love for God, God\\u2019s Word, God\\u2019s people of every ethnicity and culture and God\\u2019s purposes in the world.\\u201d IVCF \\u201cbelieves in the sanctity of marriage and desires that all married employees honor their marriage vows.\\u201d It is part of IVCF\\u2019s policy that \\u201cwjhere there are significant marital issues, IVCF encourages employees to seek appropriate help to move towards reconciliation\\u201d and IVCF reserves the right \\u201cto consider the impact of any separation/divoree on colleagues, students, faculty, and donors.\\u201d IVCF\\u2019s website includes the following regarding employment opportunities: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is both an equal opportunity employer and a faith-based religious organization. We conduct hiring without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, age, sex, marital status, parental status, membership in any labor organization, political ideology, or disability of an otherwise qualified individual. The status of IVCF as an Equal Opportunity Employer does not prevent the organization from hiring staff based on their religious beliefs so that all staff share the same religious commitment. www.intervarsity.org/jobs (last visited Jan. 9, 2015). The website states that all employees must annually reaffirm their agreement with IVCF\\u2019s Purpose Statement and Doctrinal Basis. The website includes: \\u201cPursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 702 (42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-l(a)), IVCF has the right to, and does, hire only candidates who agree with IVCF\\u2019s Statement of Agreement: Purpose and Doctrinal Basis.\\u201d *832Alyce T. Conlon began working for IVCF in 1986. In 1988, Conlon married David Roy Reimer. From 2004 to 2011, Conlon was a \\u201cspiritual director\\u201d or \\u201cSpiritual Formation Specialist\\u201d for IVCF staff members, and obtained a certification in Spiritual Direction. Her duties included assisting others to cultivate \\u201cintimacy with God and growth in Christ-like character through personal and corporate spiritual disciplines.\\u201d In March of 2011, Conlon and her husband were considering divorce, and, as required by IVCF policy, she informed her supervisor of the situation. At that time, and until May 2011, Defendant Marc Papai was Conlon\\u2019s supervisor. Defendant Fred Bailey was her acting supervisor from May 2011 until her termination. Papai put Conlon on paid leave to attempt to repair her marriage, as authorized by IVCF policy. Both Papai and Bailey were actively involved with this effort. According to the complaint, Conlon\\u2019s repeated requests to return to work were denied. Conlon also claims that in an email dated September 12, 2011, \\u201cBailey stated knowing falsehoods to several individuals that Plaintiff did not make efforts to reconcile her marriage and put her on unpaid leave.\\u201d IVCF terminated Conlon on December 20, 2011, which Conlon alleges was for \\u201cfailing to reconcile her marriage.\\u201d At that time Conlon was still married to Reimer. Conlon claims that two or more similarly situated male employees divorced their spouses during their employment, but were not disciplined or terminated. In January 2012, Reimer filed for divorce against Conlon. Shortly after her termination, Conlon filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\u201cEEOC\\u201d) and the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. On or about July 17, 2013, EEOC gave Conlon a right to sue letter that also informed her that EEOC would not be filing suit. Conlon filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 8, 2013, and filed an amended complaint on December 19, 2013, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e el seq., for gender discrimination, and of Michigan\\u2019s Elliot-Larsen Act, Mich. Comp. Laws \\u00a7 37.2101 et seq. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on January 9, 2014, asserting the ministerial exception as an affirmative defense. The district court granted the motion on April 3, 2014, and this timely appeal followed. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW We review de novo \\u201ca district court\\u2019s order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),\\u201d construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accepting all factual allegations as true. Mik v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 743 F.3d 149, 156-57 (6th Cir.2014). III. ANALYSIS This is the first opportunity since the Supreme Court\\u2019s decision in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; School v. EEOC, \\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012), for this court to address the \\u201cministerial exception.\\u201d That case \\u2014 and our decision in Hollins v. Methodist Healthcare, Inc., 474 F.3d 223 (6th Cir.2007), insofar as Hollins is consistent with it \\u2014 informs our analysis here. In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court examined the ministerial exception, first, in the context of the Framers\\u2019 historical concerns in crafting the Establishment Clause, such as English laws under which the English monarch became the head of the national church and wielded authority to appoint its ministers. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702 (citing Supremacy Act of *8331534, 26 Hen. 8, ch. 1; Act in Restraint of Annates, 25 Hen. 8, ch. 20 (1534)). The Court then reviewed similar laws and practices in America\\u2019s colonial history and the early years after the Constitution was adopted. See id. at 703-04. \\u201cIt was against this background that the First Amendment was adopted. Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church.\\u201d Id. at 703. After reviewing its own jurisprudence regarding governmental interference in churches\\u2019 selection of clergy and resolution of disputes over church properties, id. at 704-05, the Supreme Court turned to the question of whether \\u201cthis freedom of a religious organization to select its ministers is implicated by a suit alleging discrimination in employment,\\u201d id. at 705. The Court explicitly agreed with the many courts of appeals that had long recognized \\u201cthe existence of a \\u2018ministerial exception,\\u2019 grounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of Title VII and other employment discrimination laws to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.\\u201d Id. The ministerial exception is an affirmative defense that plaintiffs should first assert in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Id. at 709 n. 4.1 And in Hollins, we said that \\u201cin order for the ministerial exception to bar an employment discrimination claim, the employer must be a religious institution and the employee must have been a ministerial employee.\\u201d Hollins, 474 F.3d at 225. A. The parties agree that the ministerial exception would typically apply to federal employment-law claims. The dispute arises because Conlon claims IVCF waived the exception. However, whether the exception attaches at all is a pure question of law which this court must determine for itself. So before considering waiver, we must consider whether the ministerial exception would otherwise apply to these facts. The Supreme Court in HosannarTabor framed the issue in a religious-employment lawsuit as \\u201cwhether the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an action when the employer is a religious group and the employee is one of the group\\u2019s ministers.\\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 699. The two Religion Clauses \\u201coften exert conflicting pressures,\\u201d Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005), such that there can often be \\u201cinternal tension ... between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,\\u201d Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 677, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (plurality opinion). \\u201cNot so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government from interfering with the decision of a religious group to fire one of its ministers.\\u201d Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702. \\u201cThe Establishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their own.\\u201d Id. at 703. B. Unlike the defendant in Hosanna-Tabor, IVCF is not a church. So we must first determine whether IVCF is an organization that can assert the ministerial exception. We conclude that IVCF can claim this protection. It is undisputed *834that InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a Christian organization, whose purpose is to advance the understanding and practice of Christianity in colleges and universities. It is therefore a \\u201creligious group\\u201d under Hosannar-Tabor. Indeed, we have previously held that a Methodist hospital is \\u201ca clearly religious organization\\u201d for First Amendment purposes. Hollins, 474 F.3d at 224. Although the church in Hosanna-Tabor was part of the Missouri Synod denomination within Lutheranism, and the hospital in Hollins was specifically United Methodist within Methodisny, the ministerial exception\\u2019s applicability does not turn on its being tied to a specific denominational faith; it applies to multidenominational and nondenominational religious organizations as well. As we held in Hollins, \\u201cin order to invoke the exception, an employer need not be a traditional religious organization such as a church, diocese, or synagogue, or an entity, operated by a traditional religious organization.\\u201d Id. at 225. \\u201cA religiously affiliated entity\\u201d is one whose \\u201cmission is marked by clear or obvious religious characteristics.\\u201d Shaliehsabou v. Hebrew Home of Greater Wash., Inc., 363 F.3d 299, 310 (4th Cir.2004) (applying the ministerial exception to a Jewish nursing home). That is clearly the case for IVCF, with not only its Christian name, but its mission of Christian ministry and teaching. We must also determine whether the ministerial exception protects against the claim at issue here. Both of the cases directly on point, Hosanna-Tabor and Hollins, involved plaintiffs raising claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 12101 et seq. (\\u201cADA\\u201d). Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 701; Hollins, 474 F.3d at 224, 227. But in Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court framed the issue as whether there is a ministerial exception that precludes the application of \\u201cTitle VII ... and other employment discrimination laws\\u201d to claims of discrimination against a religious institution by its ministers, and held that there is. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 705. So we must consider whether the ministerial exception applies to Conlon\\u2019s sex-discrimination claim, which absent the exception would be a facially plausible claim under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). In Hosanna-Tabor, the Court addressed a Lutheran church school\\u2019s decision to terminate Cheryl Perich, a teacher and \\u201ccommissioned minister\\u201d who the school believed was not able to perform her duties because of a disability. See Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 705-08. The Court held that the ministerial exception precluded the courts from entertaining claims that Perich\\u2019s employment had been terminated because of her disability or in retaliation for her filing a complaint with the EEOC alleging disability discrimination. Though the Court did not \\u201cadopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister,\\u201d id. at 707, the Court identified four factors that led it to conclude Perich was a minister covered by the exception: \\u201c1 the formal title given Perich by the Church, 2 the substance reflected in that title, 3 her own use of that title, and 4 the important religious functions she performed for the Church,\\u201d id. at 708. We examine those factors here. First, the formal title. Unlike Perich, Conlon does not have the title of \\u201cminister.\\u201d Her briefs describe her as a \\u201cspiritual director,\\u201d and IVCF\\u2019s brief refers to her as a \\u201cSpiritual Formation Specialist.\\u201d We hold that either title is sufficient. \\u201cPastor,\\u201d \\u201creverend,\\u201d \\u201cpriest,\\u201d \\u201cbishop,\\u201d or \\u201crabbi\\u201d are clearly religious leadership titles no different from \\u201cminister.\\u201d Beyond that, courts need only determine whether the wording of the title conveys a religious \\u2014 as opposed to secular\\u2014 *835meaning. The word \\u201cspiritual\\u201d is such an identifying term. Second, the substance reflected in the title \\u201cSpiritual Formation Specialist\\u201d or \\u201cspiritual director.\\u201d The Hosanna-Tabor Court noted the formal seminary training that Perich received in theology, and the multi-step process whereby she was invested as a \\u201ccommissioned minister.\\u201d Id. at 699. Her title \\u201creflected a significant degree of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning.\\u201d Id. at 707. While IVCF points out that Conlon earned a certification in \\u201cspiritual direction,\\u201d we are not provided with any details to justify comparing this to the rigorous requirements Perich satisfied to earn her ministerial title, ones that clearly set her apart from laypersons. Therefore we conclude that factor has not been demonstrated here. Third, Conlon\\u2019s use of the ministerial title. The Court suggested that Perich\\u2019s position as a school teacher interacting with students and parents, and occasional worship leader in large chapel assemblies, was a form of holding herself out to the public as a minister of the Lutheran Chureh-Missouri Synod. See id. at 705-OS. Here, however, nothing in the pleadings suggests that Conlon had the sort of public role of interacting with the community as an ambassador of the faith that rises to the level of Perich\\u2019s leadership role within her church, school, and community. Therefore this factor is not present, either. Fourth, the important religious functions Conlon performed for the religious organization. Most of Perich\\u2019s -work was secular in nature, id. at 708, but included \\u201cleading others toward Christian maturity\\u201d and \\u201cteaching faithfully the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in,its truth and purity.\\u201d App. 48, quoted in Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 708. Here, part of Conlon\\u2019s duties was to assist others to cultivate \\u201cintimacy with God and growth in Christ-like character through personal and corporate spiritual disciplines.\\u201d That is a ministerial function, and so we hold the fourth factor is satisfied. Two of the four Hosanna-Tabor factors are clearly present in Conlon\\u2019s former position. The Court expressly declined to rule upon whether the exception would apply in the absence of one or more of those factors. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 708. Justice Thomas\\u2019s concurring opinion in Hosanna-Tabor looks solely to a broad reading of the first factor, positing that whenever a religious employer identifies an individual as a minister, courts should \\u201cdefer to a religious organization\\u2019s good-faith understanding of who qualifies as its minister.\\u201d Id. at 710 (Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Alito\\u2014 joined by Justice Kagan \\u2014 instead posits that the ministerial exception \\u201cshould apply to any \\u2018employee\\u2019 who 1 leads a religious organization, 2 conducts worship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger or 4 teacher of its faith.\\u201d Id. at 712 (Alito, J., concurring). That is essentially a restatement of the fourth factor. We need not decide in this case whether either of those factors alone suffices .to invoke the ministerial exception, but we do hold that where both factors \\u2014 formal title and religious function \\u2014 are present, the ministerial exception clearly applies. IVCF may assert the ministerial exception regarding Conlon\\u2019s former position. The parties point to no historical example in which the founding generation permitted any arm of the federal government \\u2014 including the judiciary \\u2014 to order a religious organization to accept or retain in a ministerial position a person whom the organization deemed unfit for ministry. To the contrary, the historical practice has always been that the government cannot dictate to a religious organization who its *836spiritual leaders would be. \\u201cBy forbidding the \\u2018establishment of religion\\u2019 and guaranteeing the \\u2018free exercise thereof,\\u2019 the Religion Clauses ensured that the new Federal Government \\u2014 unlike the English Crown\\u2014 would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices.\\u201d Id. at 703 (majority opinion). . C. Conlon argues that her claims against IVCF are not barred because IVCF waived the ministerial exception. Conlon is wrong. The ministerial exception is a structural limitation imposed on the government by the Religion Clauses, a limitation that can never be waived. It is true that in Hollins, we held that the ministerial exception can be waived, but only if \\u201cthe evidence is \\u2018clear and compelling\\u2019 that such rights were waived.\\u201d Sambo\\u2019s Restaurants, Inc. v. Ann Arbor, 663 F.2d 686, 690 (6th Cir.1981) (quoting Curtis Publ\\u2019g Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 145, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967)), quoted in Hollins, 474 F.3d at 226. But Hosannar-Tabor forecloses such waiver, abrogating that aspect of Hollins. \\u201cBoth Religion Clauses bar the government from interfering\\u201d with a religious organization\\u2019s decisions as to who will serve as ministers. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702 (emphasis added). \\u201cThe Establishment Clause ... prohibits government involvement in ecclesiastical matters.\\u201d Id. at 704 (emphasis added). It is \\u201cimpermissible for the government to contradict a church\\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers.\\u201d Id. (emphasis added). This reasoning-along with other precedents the Court cites, see, e.g., id. (collecting eases)-does not allow for a situation in which a church could explicitly waive this protection. One of our sister circuits reached the same conclusion prior to Hosanna-Tabor. See Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F.3d 1036, 1042 (7th Cir.2006) (holding \\u201cthe ministerial exception ... is not subject to waiver or estoppel\\u201d), abrogated on other grounds by Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. 694. Nor can such a waiver be reconciled with the Supreme Court\\u2019s rationale. \\u201cRequiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church.\\u201d Id. at 705 (emphasis added). The Court\\u2019s clear language recognizes that the Constitution does not permit private parties to waive the First Amendment\\u2019s ministerial exception. This constitutional protection is not only a personal one; it is a structural one that categorically prohibits federal and state governments from becoming involved in religious leadership disputes. D. We turn next to the question of whether the First Amendment\\u2019s ministerial exception can be asserted as a defense against state law claims. We hold that it can. First, the ministerial exception is recognized under Michigan law. Weishuhn v. Catholic Diocese of Lansing, 279 Mich.App. 150, 756 N.W.2d 483, 497 (2008) (\\u201cThe ministerial exception exists in Michigan. This exception bars discrimination claims where religious employers employ or have employed plaintiffs with religious positions.\\u201d). But even if it were not, because the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment by incorporation, the federal right would defeat any Michigan statute that, as applied, violates the First Amendment. Indeed, in a footnote, the Supreme Court suggested it approved of the Hosanna-Tabor plaintiffs admission that if the ministerial exception applied in her case regarding federal law, the exception would also bar her claims under Michigan state law. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 709 n. 3 (\\u201cPerich does not dispute that if the ministerial exception *837bars her retaliation claim under the ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim under Michigan law.\\u201d). Moreover, the Establishment Clause applies with the same force against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 380 U.S. 1, 15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), as does the Free Exercise Clause, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). And HosanncuTabor based its holding fashioning the ministerial exception in part on Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N.A., 344 U.S. 94, 73 S.Ct. 143, 97 L.Ed. 120 (1952), see Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 704-05, which, although not a ministerial exception case per se, was a case in which the Court held that the First Amendment invalidated the state law at issue, see Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 116-19, 73 S.Ct. 143. Therefore the claims brought under Michigan\\u2019s Elliott-Larsen .Act fare no better than those brought under Title VII. See U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2 (Supremacy Clause). E. We turn finally to whether the individual supervisors \\u2014 Bailey and Papai \\u2014 can be held liable under Michigan law because they cannot claim the ministerial exception. They cannot be held liable. Nothing in federal court or Michigan court precedent suggests that Bailey and Papai cannot claim the ministerial exception when personally sued for discrimination as the agents of a religious employer. Holding the individual decision maker liable for the very employment decision for which the organization cannot be held liable would vitiate both the purpose and the effect of the ministerial exception. F. Because IVCF is a religious organization and Conlon was a ministerial employee, IVCF\\u2019s decision to terminate her employment cannot be challenged under federal or state employment discrimination laws. It matters not whether the plaintiff is claiming a specific violation under Title VII or any other employment discrimination statute. The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses do not permit federal or state courts to adjudicate such matters when the defendant properly asserts the ministerial exception as an affirmative defense. As the Supreme Court concluded: The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 710. IV. CONCLUSION The Religion Clauses\\u2019 ministerial exception bars federal and state employment-law claims against all the defendants here. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. . This abrogated our ruling in Hollins that the ministerial exception deprives a court of subject-matter jurisdiction, Hollins, 474 F.3d at 225, which a plaintiff should raise under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\",\n          \"citation: 107 A.3d 1250, parties: ILDA AGUAS, PLAINTIFF-APPELLANT, v. STATE OF NEW JERSEY, DEFENDANT-RESPONDENT., otherdate: Argued September 23, 2014, decisiondate: Decided February 11, 2015., p: Albin, J., filed dissenting opinion in which Rabner, C.J., joined.\\nDate Filed: 2015-02-11\\nAuthor: Patterson\\nOpinion ID: 9805986\\nType: 020lead\\nOpinion Text:\\nJustice PATTERSON delivered the opinion of the Court. In Lehmann v. Toys \\u2018R\\u2019 Us, Inc., this Court held that an employer may be vicariously liable, in accordance with principles of agency law, for sexual harassment committed by a supervisor that results in a hostile work environment. 132 N.J. 587, 592, 626 A.2d 445 (1993). Citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \\u00a7 219(2) hereinafter Restatement , the Court held that when a supervisor acts beyond \\u201cthe scope of his or her employment, the employer will be vicariously liable if the employer contributed to the harm through its negligence, intent, or apparent authorization of the harassing conduct, or if the supervisor was aided in the commis*499sion of the harassment by the agency relationship.\\u201d Id. at 624, 626 A.2d 445. In this case, plaintiff Ilda Aguas (Aguas), a corrections officer, alleges that two of her supervisors subjected her to sexual harassment in the workplace. Aguas asserted negligence and vicarious liability claims premised on the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination, N.J.S.A. 10:5-1 to -49 (LAD). She appeals from the Appellate Division\\u2019s decision affirming the trial court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment dismissing her claims. Aguas\\u2019s appeal requires that we determine two issues that were generally addressed, but not expressly decided, in Lehmann and subsequent decisions by this Court. First, we address the impact of an employer\\u2019s anti-harassment policy on an employee\\u2019s negligence or recklessness claim under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b), and on a vicarious liability claim under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). We reaffirm that an employer\\u2019s implementation and enforcement of an effective anti-harassment policy, or its failure to maintain such a policy, is a critical factor in determining negligence and recklessness claims under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b). For claims alleging vicarious liability for supervisory sexual harassment under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), we adopt as the governing standard the test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Burlington Industries v. Ellerth, 524 U.S. 742, 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d 633, 655 (1998) and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807-08, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2292-93, 141 L.Ed. 2d 662, 689 (1998). Under the Ellerth/Fa,ragher analysis, the employer in a hostile work environment sexual harassment case may assert as an affirmative defense to vicarious liability that it \\u201cexercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior,\\u201d and \\u201cthe plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise,\\u201d provided that the employer has not taken an adverse tangible employment action against the plaintiff employee. Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765,118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655; *500Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 807-08, 118 S.Ct. at 2292-93, 141 L.Ed.2 d at 689. The Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense derives from agency principles adopted by this Court in Lehmann. It furthers the LAD\\u2019s purpose of eliminating sexual harassment in the workplace by motivating employers to maintain effective anti-harassment policies, and by encouraging employees to take prompt action against harassing supervisors in accordance with those policies. Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 626, 626 A.2d 445. The affirmative defense is consonant with this Court\\u2019s prior jurisprudence and advances the legislative goal of the LAD. Second, we consider the factors that trial courts should apply when determining whether an employee, accused of sexually harassing another employee, is that individual\\u2019s supervisor\\u2014a term undefined in the LAD and our prior case law\\u2014for purposes of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim. We hold that an allegedly harassing employee is the complainant\\u2019s supervisor if that employee had the authority to take or recommend tangible employment actions affecting the complaining employee, or to direct the complainant\\u2019s day-to-day activities in the workplace. So that the trial court may decide this ease in accordance with these standards, we reverse the Appellate Division\\u2019s affirmance of summary judgment dismissing Aguas\\u2019s claims and remand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings. I. Effective on December 16,1999, the New Jersey Department of Corrections (DOC) instituted a written policy prohibiting discrimination in the workplace and mandated that all employees be trained with respect to it. The policy states a commitment \\u201cto providing every State employee and prospective employee with a work environment free from discrimination or harassment.\\u201d It proscribes \\u201csexual (or gender-based) harassment of any kind.\\u201d Among other prohibited behaviors, the policy bars \\u201cujnwanted physical contact such as intentional touching, grabbing, pinching, *501brushing against another\\u2019s body or impeding or blocking movement,\\u201d as well as \\u201cvjerbal, written, or electronic sexually suggestive or obscene comments, jokes or propositions.\\u201d The DOC policy imposes special responsibilities on supervisors. It charges supervisors to ensure \\u201ca work environment that is free from any form of discrimination/harassment\\u201d and subjects supervisors who fail to meet its requirements with sanctions that may include termination of employment. The DOC policy incorporates \\u201cthe State of New Jersey Model Procedures with regard to reporting, investigating, and where appropriate, remediating claims of discrimination/harassment,\\u201d pursuant to N.J.AC. 4A;7-3.2.1 It requires the designation of a responsible individual or individuals to handle employee discrimination and harassment complaints. The policy \\u201cencourages\\u201d employees subjected to harassment to \\u201cpromptly report the incidentes) to either a supervisor, or directly to the DOC\\u2019s Equal Employment Division/Affirmative Action Officer,\\u201d without specifying that the employee must report the incident in waiting. The policy mandates that the DOC conduct investigations of such complaints \\u201cin a prompt, thorough and impartial manner\\u201d that respects \\u201cthe privacy of all persons involved.\\u201d The DOC Commissioner is charged with making a final determination as to whether a policy violation has occurred. If a complaint is substantiated, the DOC is required to \\u201ctake prompt and appropriate remedial action to stop the behavior and deter its reoccurrence,\\u201d including interim separation of the alleged harasser from the complainant employee pending a final determination. The DOC policy bars retaliation against a complaining employee. *502In 2004, Aguas was hired by the DOC as a Corrections Officer Recruit. The following year, she became a Senior Corrections Officer, assigned to the third shift, 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women (Edna Mahan). Aguas acknowledged that she received a copy of the DOC anti-discrimination and harassment policy, but denied receiving training with respect to that policy. However, Aguas twice instituted written complaints pursuant to the DOC\\u2019s antidiscrimination policy, the first a discrimination complaint filed in 2005 against a female co-worker, and the second a workplace violence complaint filed in 2007 against a different female co-worker. The DOC found both complaints to be unsubstantiated. Aguas was supervised by Darryl McClish (McClish), an Area Lieutenant who has worked for the DOC since 1989 and at Edna Mahan since 2009. During the third shift, McClish was the highest-ranking supervisor at the correctional facility, overseeing the work of sixty employees. He was assisted in that role by two male officers, Sergeant Robin Hill (Hill) and Sergeant Eric Sands (Sands). Aguas alleges that McClish sexually harassed her on several occasions, beginning in October 2009. She asserts that on one evening that month, as she completed her shift and left the facility, McClish stood next to her very closely and asked \\u201care we going to a telly,\\u201d which she interpreted as a reference to a motel. Aguas contends that McClish then made a comment about another officer, Lieutenant Rudolph Walz (Walz), suggesting that Aguas had a romantic relationship with Walz. McClish denies this allegation. Later the same evening, Aguas took her handcuffs home in contravention of the DOC policy, and McClish called and demanded her immediate return to the correctional facility. Aguas alleges that when she returned with the handcuffs, McClish sniffed the handcuffs and asked, \\u201cwhere you been? If you just want to borrow them, let me know.\\u201d She contends that McClish then \\u201csat in her lap face-to-face while blowing his whistle and gave her a *503\\u2018lap dance\\u2019 by grinding his pelvis into her and shaking his face close to her face.\\u201d Aguas alleges that McClish persisted in this behavior despite her warning to stop, and that another corrections officer and a lieutenant on the scene purposely looked in the other direction while the conduct was occurring. McClish agrees that he ordered Aguas to return to the facility with the handcuffs, but otherwise denies Aguas\\u2019s allegations regarding this incident, and denies that he touched Aguas with his waist, hip or groin on any occasion. Aguas next alleges that later in the same month, McClish massaged her shoulders, out of view of any other employees, when he and Aguas were conducting nightly rounds of the corrections facility. She asserts that he then \\u201cstuck out his buttocks toward Aguas, flexed his arms and said, \\u2018djo me a favor and take my radio off my hip. I worked out and I\\u2019m sore,\\u2019 \\u201d a direction that she declined to follow. McClish denies both allegations. Aguas contends that a few days after that incident, McClish commented twice, in her presence, about her alleged relationship with Walz. She asserts that immediately after she complained to McClish about the comments, McClish approached her from behind, \\u201cput her in a hold with her hands behind her back and pulled up to her shoulder blades.\\u201d According to Aguas, McClish then \\u201cbent Aguas over the table with his genital area touching her buttocks and repeatedly said, \\u2018what are you going to do?\\u2019 \\u201d Aguas asserts that she immediately kicked and head-butted McClish repeatedly and that the two fell to the floor, prompting McClish to release her. She alleges that McClish then \\u201cstarted bobbing like a boxer\\u201d and repeated his question, \\u201cwhat are you going to do?\\u201d According to Aguas, when she returned from a trip to the bathroom a few minutes later, \\u201cMcClish got very close behind her and started dancing, whooping, waving his arms, and blowing his whistle while repeatedly saying \\u2018woohoo!\\u2019 as if she was a stripper.\\u201d Aguas claims that McClish then made a derogatory comment about Walz. She asserts that when she confronted McClish about this behavior days later, telling McClish that his *504alleged actions made her feel uncomfortable and \\u201clike a whore, like a slut,\\u201d he responded that he was not sorry. McClish denies these allegations in their entirety, and maintains that the conversations recounted by Aguas did not occur. Aguas contends that on January 23, 2010, she set off the alarm in the metal detector at Edna Mahan. According to Aguas, Hill asked her whether she had \\u201cpiercings in her breasts because I know you don\\u2019t need an underwire bra,\\u201d and directed a female officer to repeatedly pat-frisk Aguas. Hill testified that, in compliance with the DOC policy, he ordered a female officer to pat-frisk Aguas after she failed to clear the metal detector.2 Hill denied making the remark alleged by Aguas. Finally, Aguas contends that Sands subjected her to \\u201chyper-scrutiny,\\u201d selectively reprimanding her for uniform violations committed by several officers, for smoking outside on her break with a sweater around her shoulders, and for not carrying a red pen. The parties dispute the timing of Aguas\\u2019s reporting of her sexual harassment allegations. Aguas contends that she reported McClish\\u2019s harassment to Walz on several occasions beginning in October 2009. Walz testified, however, that Aguas reported to him only the conversation with Hill involving the metal detector, and the excessive scrutiny of her uniform, and that she did not complain to him at any time about alleged sexual harassment by McClish. Aguas reported her allegations that McClish sexually harassed her to Captain and Acting Chief Robert Ryan (Ryan), the highest officer in command, and Ryan advised her to meet with Assistant Administrator Helen Adams (Adams). Aguas asserts that she rejected Adams\\u2019s advice to report the harassment in writing because she feared retaliation. She declined the DOC\\u2019s alterna*505tive suggestion that she participate in a group meeting with the DOC officials, McClish, Sands and Hill. Aguas contends that Adams gave her forms to prepare a written report and a referral to the facility\\u2019s psychologist. According to Aguas, she became distraught at the meeting with Adams and was subsequently hospitalized for a migraine and placed on medical leave. A few days later, Aguas received two text messages from a fellow Edna Mahan officer, which she interpreted as a warning not to file a written complaint. Aguas did not file a written complaint with the DOC. On March 8, 2010, the DOC\\u2019s Equal Employment Division (EED) advised Aguas in writing that it had initiated an investigation of her verbal complaint of sexual harassment. Over the next several weeks, an EED investigator interviewed Aguas, McClish, Walz and seventeen other witnesses, and obtained statements from others. The EED investigator summarized her findings in a report dated April 21, 2010. The investigator concluded that Aguas\\u2019s allegations were unsubstantiated, and advised Aguas of that conclusion in writing. II. On March 10, 2010, two days after the EED commenced its investigation of her complaints, Aguas filed this action. She named the State as the sole defendant and asserted claims under the LAD for compensatory and punitive damages and other relief. Aguas alleged that the sexual harassment by McClish and Hill subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her gender, and that the State retaliated against her because of her objections to that harassment, in violation of the LAD. Aguas did not allege that the DOC took any tangible employment action against her. In its answer, the State pled, as affirmative defenses, its \\u201cprompt and remedial action\\u201d in response to Aguas\\u2019s claim, its policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation, and its \\u201cthorough investigation\\u201d of Aguas\\u2019s complaint. *506Following discovery, the trial court granted the State\\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held that Aguas had presented a prima facie showing that she had been subjected to severe and pervasive sexual harassment, and that the conduct created a hostile or abusive work environment for her. It concluded, however, that the State had established an affirmative defense. The court noted that the DOC had a written policy against discrimination, harassment and retaliation that included a procedure for reporting through the EED, a procedure that Aguas had used in the past. The trial court construed the policy to require the filing of a written complaint by an employee. It held that Aguas had failed to take steps required by the policy. The trial court therefore dismissed Aguas\\u2019s LAD sexual harassment claims, based on theories of negligence and recklessness, as well as vicarious liability. Due to its rejection of Aguas\\u2019s claims for compensatory damages, the trial court also granted summary judgment dismissing Aguas\\u2019s claim for punitive damages.3 Aguas appealed, and an Appellate Division panel affirmed the trial court\\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The panel concluded that the State exercised due care in its investigation of Aguas\\u2019s claim and concurred with the trial court\\u2019s dismissal of Aguas\\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim. It also agreed with the trial court that the State had established an affirmative defense, by indisputable proof, based upon the DOC\\u2019s adoption and implementation of a policy against discrimination and sexual harassment, a policy that Aguas admittedly received in writing annually. The panel rejected Aguas\\u2019s claim that the State was liable under the agency principles of Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), holding that Aguas had failed to show that McClish used his authority to control her day-to-day working environment to aid his sexual harassment of her. It also affirmed the trial court\\u2019s dismissal of Aguas\\u2019s claim for punitive damages. *507We granted Aguas\\u2019s petition for certification. Aguas v. State, 216 N.J. 86, 77 A.3d 489 (2013). III. Aguas argues that the Appellate Division created a novel test, in contravention of this Court\\u2019s decision in Lehmann and public policy, which requires an employee to file a formal report under the employer\\u2019s policy before pursuing legal remedies. She concedes that an employer may present evidence of its implementation and enforcement of an explicit policy against sexual harassment and its provision of an effective investigatory and remedial procedure in defense of a negligence claim. She denies that a plaintiff in a sexual harassment case has the burden of proof, and instead contends that the employer\\u2019s policy gives rise to an affirmative defense as to which the defendant has the burden of proof. Aguas argues that in any event, the State cannot establish such a defense based on the record in this case. Aguas contends that the Appellate Division misapplied Lehmann by declining to find the State vicariously liable based on principles of agency. She argues that under Lehmann, when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate, the employer is presumed liable whether or not the subordinate reports the harassment, and that the Ellerth/Faragher analysis does not govern cases involving supervisors under the LAD. Finally, Aguas contends that the Appellate Division improperly affirmed the dismissal of her claim for punitive damages because she established an underlying violation of the LAD. The State counters that the DOC implemented an effective anti-sexual harassment policy, enforced that policy and took immediate remedial action in response to Aguas\\u2019s complaint, and that it was Aguas\\u2019s duty to utilize the grievance procedure. It argues that sexual harassment by a supervisor is not a per se violation of the LAD except where a tangible employment action is taken against the employee who has alleged harassment. The State asserts that the United States Supreme Court\\u2019s Ellerth/Faragher analysis *508applies to cases involving supervisors, and that unless the supervisor\\u2019s harassment prompts a tangible employment action and the plaintiff seeks equitable relief, the employer may assert an affirmative defense under that analysis. Amicus curiae National Employment Lawyers Association of New Jersey (NELA) argues that the Appellate Division contravened Lehmann and other authority by holding that McClish, the highest-level manager on his shift at Edna Mahan, lacked sufficient authority to be considered a supervisor for purposes of vicarious liability. NELA asserts that the Appellate Division improperly focused on McClish\\u2019s authority to discipline Aguas and affect her economic status, rather than on his capacity to oversee her day-to-day work. NELA argues that New Jersey law does not require an employee who is a victim of sexual harassment to formally report the harassment in writing in order to trigger an investigation and remediation. Amicus curiae Employers Association of New Jersey (EANJ) urges the Court to hold that an employer cannot, as a matter of law, be liable for a hostile work environment under the LAD if it took prompt remedial action in response to an employee\\u2019s complaint of sexual harassment. EANJ argues that the DOC satisfied its duty of care by implementing and enforcing a detailed procedure. It asserts that Aguas should be barred from recovering under the LAD because she unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive and corrective measures that were available to her. TV. A. We first consider the impact of the DOC\\u2019s anti-harassment policy on Aguas\\u2019s two claims for sexual harassment giving rise to a hostile work environment: her direct claim for negligence and recklessness against the State based on Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b), and her claim that the State is vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by McClish and Hill under Restatement *509\\u00a7 219(2)(d). The decisions that defined these claims provide the setting for our analysis. In Lehmann, supra, this Court recognized sexual harassment in the workplace as a form of discrimination that is prohibited by the LAD. 132 N.J. at 601, 626 A.2d 445 (citing Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson, FSB, 477 U.S. 57, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986); Erickson v. Marsh &amp; McLennan Co., 117 N.J. 539, 555-56, 569 A.2d 793 (1990)). The Court recognized two forms of sexual harassment that are actionable under the LAD. The first is \\u201cquid pro quo sexual harassment,\\u201d in which \\u201can employer attempts to make an employee\\u2019s submission to sexual demands a condition of his or her employment.\\u201d Ibid. Aguas does not assert a quid pro quo harassment claim in this case. The second cause of action for sexual harassment, at issue here, is a claim for \\u201chostile work environment sexual harassment.\\u201d Ibid. To prove this claim, a plaintiff must show that the harassment \\u201c(1) would not have occurred but for the employee\\u2019s gender; and it was (2) severe or pervasive enough to make a (3) reasonable woman believe that (4) the conditions of employment are altered and the working environment is hostile or abusive.\\u201d Id. at 603-04, 626 A.2d 445 (emphasis omitted). As the Court identified the elements of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim in Lehmann, it also addressed the issue of employer liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor or co-employee. Id. at 615-24, 626 A.2d 445. It held that \\u201cthe employer is directly and strictly liable for all equitable damages and relief\\u2019 to the extent that an employee subjected to discrimination or sexual harassment seeks equitable remedies, that is, restoration \\u201cto the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment the employee would have enjoyed but for the workplace discrimination or harassment.\\u201d Id. at 617, 626 A.2d 445. With respect to claims for damages, however, the Court declined to hold an employer strictly liable for sexual harassment committed by its employee. Ibid. Instead of strict liability, the Court adopted as the measure *510of employer liability a fact-sensitive standard derived from the law of agency. Id. at 620, 626 A.2d 445. In its rejection of strict liability, the Court relied on Meritor, then the United States Supreme Court\\u2019s sole authority on hostile work environment sexual harassment cases. Id. at 618-19, 626 A.2d 445 (citing Meritor Sav. Bank, supra, 477 U.S. at 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2408, 91 L.Ed.2d at 63).4 In Meritor, supra, the United States Supreme Court majority declined to impose strict liability on employers in hostile work environment harassment cases and instead invoked the agency principles set forth in Restatement \\u00a7\\u00a7 219-237. 477 U.S. at 69-70, 72, 106 S.Ct. at 2407-08, 91 L.Ed.2 &amp; at 61, 63. In a concurring opinion, Justice Marshall urged the adoption of a strict liability standard in both quid pro quo and hostile work environment cases. Id. at 74-78,106 S.Ct. at 2409-11, 91 L.Ed.2d at 64-66 (Marshall, J., concurring). Justice Stevens joined both opinions because he shared the majority\\u2019s rejection of strict liability and the concurring opinion\\u2019s construction of Title VII. Id. at 73, 106 S.Ct. at 2409, 91 L.Ed.2d at 64 (Stevens, J., concurring). Contrary to the argument of our dissenting colleagues, who contend that in Lehmann the Court \\u201cdeclined to follow\\u201d the Meritor majority in favor of Justice Marshall\\u2019s strict liability approach, post at 536-37, 107 A.3d at 1277-78, the Court actually *511embraced the agency analysis of the majority in Meritor. It concurred \\u201cwith Justice Stevens that there is no inherent contradiction between the majority\\u2019s adoption of agency principles and Justice Marshall\\u2019s observation that a supervisor\\u2019s delegated authority often goes beyond the power to hire and fire.\\u201d Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 619, 626 A.2d 445. The Court noted: We recognize that although we have declined to hold employers strictly liable for hostile work environment sexual harassment by supervisors, we have created a standard that may often result in employers being held vicariously liable for such harassment. We note that there is an important difference between strict liability and vicarious liability under agency law. Under a strict liability standard, an employer would always be liable for supervisory hostile work environment sexual harassment, regardless of the specific facts of the case. We think that in some cases strict liability would be unjust\\u2014for example, \\u201cwhere a supervisor rapes one of his subordinates in the workplace.\\u201d Id. at 628-24, 626 A.2d 445 (emphasis in original) (quoting T.L. v. Toys \\u2018R\\u2019 Us, Inc., 255 N.J.Super. 616, 661, 605 A.2d 1125 (App.Div.1992) (Skillman, J.A.D., dissenting)). The agency principles adopted by the Court in Lehmann are set forth in Restatement \\u00a7 219, which recognizes four exceptions to the general rule that an employer is not liable for its employee\\u2019s conduct beyond the scope of his or her employment: 1. A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants committed while acting in the scope of their employment. 2. A master is not subject to liability for the torts of his servants acting outside the scope of their employment, unless: (a) the master intended the conduct or the consequences, or (b) the master was negligent or reckless, or (c) the conduct violated a non-delegable duty of the master, or (d) the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation. Restatement \\u00a7 219. As the Court noted in Lehmann, supra, the agency principles of Restatement \\u00a7 219 \\u201care sufficiently well-established to provide employers with notice of their potential liability, and also sufficiently flexible to provide just results in the great variety of factual circumstances presented by sexual harassment cases and *512to accomplish the purposes of the LAD.\\u201d 132 N.J. at 619, 626 A.2d 445. Since this Court\\u2019s decision in Lehmann, our courts have recognized two primary categories of claims against employers for sexual harassment committed by their employees under Restatement \\u00a7 219. The first is a direct cause of action against the employer for negligence or recklessness under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b). See, e.g., Gaines v. Bellino, 173 N.J. 301, 312-14, 801 A.2d 322 (2002). The second is a claim for vicarious liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). See ibid. Although direct claims for negligence or recklessness under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b) and claims for vicarious liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) are often discussed in tandem, they are analytically distinct from and independent of one another. When both are pled in a sexual harassment action, as they are in this case, the two claims must be addressed separately. Guided by our jurisprudence and agency principles adopted as the benchmark for employer liability, we consider in turn the relevance of the DOC\\u2019s anti-harassment policy to Aguas\\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim based on Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b), and the role of that policy in Aguas\\u2019s vicarious liability claim premised upon Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). B. As the parties agree, the DOC\\u2019s anti-harassment policy is central to the determination of Aguas\\u2019s claim for negligence and recklessness under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b). The negligence standard imposes on Aguas the burden to prove that the State failed to exercise due care with respect to sexual harassment in the workplace, that its breach of the duty of due care caused the plaintiffs harm, and that she sustained damages. See generally, Komlodi v. Picciano, 217 N.J. 387, 409, 89 A.3d 1234 (2014); Robinson v. Vivirito, 217 N.J. 199, 208, 86 A.3d 119 (2014) (citing Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co. v. Melcar Util. Co., 212 N.J. 576, *513594, 59 A.3d 561 (2013); Weinberg v. Dinger, 106 N.J. 469, 484, 524 A.2d 366 (1987)). In Gaines, supra, the Court identified five factors that are relevant to a negligence claim against an employer in a sexual harassment case. 173 N.J. at 313, 801 A.2d 322. Those factors inelude the existence of: (1) formal policies prohibiting harassment in the workplace; (2) complaint structures for employees\\u2019 use, both formal and informal in nature; (3) anti-harassment training, which must be mandatory for supervisors and managers, and must be available to all employees of the organization; (4) the existence of effective sensing or monitoring mechanisms to check the trustworthiness of the policies and complaint structures; and (5) an unequivocal commitment from the highest levels of the employer that harassment would not be tolerated, and demonstration of that policy commitment by consistent practice. Ibid. (citing Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 620, 626 A.2d 445). Applying that standard to the Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b) negligence claim before it, the Court found that because of the deficiencies in the employer\\u2019s policy, a genuine issue of material fact barred summary judgment with respect to two of the factors relevant to a negligence claim against an employer under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b). Id. at 315-17, 319, 801 A.2d 322. The Court further noted that Lehmann had recognized that \\u201cthe existence of effective preventative mechanisms may provide evidence of due care on the part of the employer.\\u201d Id. at 314, 801 A.2d 322 (citing Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 621-22, 626 A.2d 445). It observed that in Lehmann, the Court declined \\u201cto hold that the absence of such mechanisms, or any part of them, automatically constituted negligence, and similarly rejected the converse proposition that the presence of such mechanisms categorically demonstrated the absence of negligence.\\u201d Ibid, (citing Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 621-22, 626 A.2d 445). As the Court stated in Gaines, however, \\u201cthe efficacy of an employer\\u2019s remedial program is highly pertinent to an employer\\u2019s defense.\\u201d Ibid. Under the Gaines analysis, the DOC\\u2019s anti-harassment policy is relevant to the elements of Aguas\\u2019s Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b) cause of action. If Aguas\\u2019s negligence and recklessness claim under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b) is challenged in a *514dispositive motion on remand, or is tried before a jury, evidence of the State\\u2019s anti-harassment policy should be considered in accordance with the factors identified in Gaines. C. Under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), an employee may assert that the employer is vicariously hable for sexual harassment committed by its employee because the sexual harasser purported to act on the employer\\u2019s behalf and \\u201cthere was reliance upon his or her apparent authority,\\u201d or because the harasser \\u201cwas aided in his or her misconduct by the existence of an agency relationship\\u201d with his or her employer. See Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 619, 626 A.2d 445. In Lehmann, the Court held that a vicarious liability claim under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) \\u201crequires a detailed fact-specific analysis\\u201d and stated a four-part test for the factfinder: 1. Did the employer delegate the authority to the supervisor to control the situation of which the plaintiff complains ... ? 2. Did the supervisor exercise that authority? 3. Did the exercise of authority result in a violation of the LAD? 4. Did the authority delegated by the employer to the supervisor aid the supervisor in injuring the plaintiff? Id. at 620, 626 A.2d 445 (citation omitted). If each of these questions are answered in the affirmative, \\u201cthen the employer is vicariously liable for the supervisor\\u2019s harassment under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d).\\u201d Ibid. This Court\\u2019s prior jurisprudence does not address in detail the analytical framework under which an employer\\u2019s anti-harassment policy may be considered in a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim involving a supervisor. Nonetheless, that jurisprudence strongly supports the availability of an affirmative defense, based on the employer\\u2019s creation and enforcement of an effective policy against sexual harassment, in a vicarious liability claim based on Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). *515First, the Restatement provision at the heart of the Court\\u2019s analysis in Lehmann sets forth agency principles that directly implicate an employer\\u2019s policy, or its lack of a policy, against sexual harassment in the workplace. See id. at 619, 626 A.2d 445 (citing Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d)). The existence and enforcement of a policy charging supervisors with ensuring a harassment-free workplace is central to the questions raised by Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d): whether a harassing supervisor \\u201cpurports to act or to speak on behalf of the principal,\\u201d whether \\u201cthere was reliance upon that supervisor\\u2019s apparent authority,\\u201d and whether a harasser was \\u201caided in accomplishing\\u201d the harassment by \\u201cthe existence of the agency relation.\\u201d Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d).5 Second, in rejecting strict liability, the Court in Lehmann, swpra, clearly envisioned that an employer would be permitted to argue that vicarious liability should not be imposed in the circumstances of the individual case. See 132 N.J. at 624, 626 A.2d 445 (explaining that \\u201cunder agency law, an employer\\u2019s liability for a supervisor\\u2019s sexual harassment will depend on the facts of the case\\u201d). Third, the Court held that any legal test governing vicarious liability claims should motivate employers to create and enforce a policy against harassment. Id. at 626, 626 A.2d 445. The Court *516observed that an effective legal test allows employees \\u201cto know their rights in a given set of circumstances,\\u201d and permits \\u201cemployers to set policies and procedures that comply with that test.\\u201d Id. at 603, 626 A.2d 445. Noting that \\u201ceourtrooms are not the best place to prevent or remedy a hostile work environment,\\u201d id. at 625, 626 A.2d 445, the Court observed: The most important tool in the prevention of sexual harassment is the education of both employees and employers. Consensus among employees and employers should be the goal. We think that providing employers with the incentive not only to provide voluntary compliance programs but also to insist on the effective enforcement of their programs will do much to ensure that hostile work environment discrimination claims disappear from the workplace and the courts. Id. at 626, 626 A.2d 445. The Court\\u2019s intention that its legal test motivate employers to implement and enforce \\u201cvoluntary compliance programs\\u201d strongly signals that such compliance programs, if effective and enforced, may give rise to an affirmative defense to an LAD claim. Ibid. Thus, although the Court did not delineate in Lehmann the precise role that an anti-sexual harassment policy should play in a vicarious liability sexual harassment ease brought under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), it foresaw a fact-specific inquiry in which the employer\\u2019s implementation of a meaningful anti-harassment policy, or its failure to do so, would be, in many cases, an important factor. See id. at 620, 622-24, 626 A.2d 445. The Court\\u2019s subsequent authority affirms this principle. In Cavuoti v. New Jersey Transit Corp., a case involving the standard for an award of punitive damages against an employer in supervisor sexual harassment litigation, the Court reiterated that an employer\\u2019s anti-harassment policy is a significant factor in such cases. 161 N.J. 107,113,120-21, 735 A.2d 548 (1999). This Court commented that \\u201clike the United States Supreme Court we have afforded a form of a safe haven for employers who promulgate and support an active, anti-harassment policy.\\u201d Id. at 120-21, 735 A.2d 548. The Court further observed: A company that develops policies reflecting a lack of tolerance for harassment will have less concern about hostile work environment or punitive damages claims if its good-faith attempts include periodic publication to workers of the employer\\u2019s *517anti-harassment policy; an effective and practical grievance process; and training sessions for workers, supervisors, and managers about how to recognize and eradicate unlawful harassment. Id. at 121, 785 A.2d 548. Finally, in Gaines, supra, the Court expressly confirmed the availability of an affirmative defense to vicarious liability based on an effective policy against sexual harassment. It held that \\u201ca defendant is entitled to assert the existence of an effective anti-sexual harassment workplace policy as an affirmative defense to vicarious liability; however, material issues of disputed fact in the context of a motion record can deny a defendant summary dismissal based on that defense.\\u201d 173 N.J. at 320, 801 A.2d 322. Notwithstanding that clear language, our dissenting colleagues inexplicably assert that the Court \\u201cnever hinted that an affirmative defense applied to supervisory liability under the Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) approach.\\u201d Post at 535, 107 A.3d at 1276. The dissent also asserts that in Gaines, the Court stated only that an affirmative defense is available to an employer in a negligence case under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b). Post at 535-36, 107 A.3d at 1276-77. In fact, the Court expressly recognized in Gaines an affirmative defense to a Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) claim for vicarious liability. See Gaines, supra, 173 N.J. at 320, 801 A.2d 322; see also Godfrey v. Princeton Theological Seminary, 196 N.J. 178, 200, 952 A.2d 1034 (2008) (stating that \\u201cthe means employed by an institution to deter harassment, and the enforcement of those means, may be considered when assessing that institution\\u2019s vicarious liability\\u201d). Thus, the Court\\u2019s prior case law provides important guidance with respect to this issue. In Lehmann, Cavuoti and Gaines, the Court acknowledged the value of effective anti-harassment policies in combatting sexual harassment in the workplace, and recognized that employers will be motivated to implement and enforce such policies if their policies provide a defense to a claim of vicarious liability. See Gaines, supra, 173 N.J. at 320, 801 A.2d 322; Cavuoti, supra, 161 N.J. at 120-21, 735 A.2d 548; Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 619, 626, 626 A.2d 445. *518As in other settings involving the LAD, we consider federal law construing Title VII with respect to this issue. In Ellerth and Faragher, the United States Supreme Court addressed Title VII vicarious liability claims premised on principles of agency. These cases, which had not been decided when this Court decided Lehmann, represent part of the evolution in federal law that has occurred as employer anti-harassment policies have become more prevalent in the workplace. Ellerth and Faragher arose from a supervisor\\u2019s alleged sexual harassment of a subordinate, which gave rise to a hostile work environment.6 The Supreme Court confirmed that Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) provides the analytical framework for supervisory sexual harassment cases because \\u201cthe agency relationship affords contact with an employee subjected to a supervisor\\u2019s sexual harassment, and the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the whistle on a superior.\\u201d Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 803,118 S.Ct. at 2291,141 L.Ed.2d at 686. The Supreme Court noted, however, that the proper analysis \\u201ccalls not for a mechanical application of indefinite and malleable factors set forth in the Restatement ... but rather an inquiry into the reasons that would support a conclusion that harassing behavior ought to be held within the scope of a supervisor\\u2019s employment, and the reasons for the opposite view.\\u201d Id. at 797,118 S.Ct. at 2288,141 L.Ed. 2d at 682. The Supreme Court further observed that the agency principles it espoused must be consonant with Mentor, in which it had declined to impose strict liability on employers in supervisor sexual harassment cases. Id. at 804, 118 S.Ct. at 2291, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686 (footnote omitted); see also Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 755, 118 S.Ct. at 2266, 141 L.Ed.2d at *519649. In Faragher, supra, the Court explained that \\u201cthere is obviously some tension between Meritor\\u2019s holding and the position that a supervisor\\u2019s misconduct aided by supervisory authority subjects the employer to liability vicariously; if the \\u2018aid\\u2019 may be the unspoken suggestion of retaliation by misuse of supervisory authority, the risk of automatic liability is high.\\u201d Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 804, 118 S.Ct at 2291, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686 (footnote omitted). The Supreme Court identified two \\u201cbasic alternatives\\u201d by which Meritor\\u2019s rejection of strict liability could be reconciled with the Restatement\\u2019s analysis: a requirement that a plaintiff provide proof that the supervisor affirmatively invoked his or her authority, or the recognition of \\u201can affirmative defense to liability in some circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionable environment.\\u201d Ibid. The Court rejected the first alternative, noting the vagueness and impracticality of such a test: Application of the standard is made difficult by its malleable terminology, which can be read to either expand or limit liability in the context of supervisor harassment. On the one hand, a supervisor\\u2019s power and authority invests his or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character, and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency relation. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 77,106 S.Ct. at 2410, 91 L.Ed,.2d at 66 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment) (\\u201cIt is precisely because the supervisor is understood to be clothed with the employer\\u2019s authority that he is able to impose unwelcome sexual conduct on subordinates\\u201d). On the other hand, there are acts of harassment a supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a co-employee would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the supervisor\\u2019s status makes little difference. Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 763,118 S.Ct. at 2269,141 L.Ed.2d at 654. In reconciling the test of Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) with Meritor \\u2019s rejection of strict liability, the Supreme Court embraced the second alternative: the recognition of an affirmative defense. Id. at 765,118 S.Ct. at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655; Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 805-06, 118 S.Ct. at 2290, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686. In so doing, the Supreme Court emphasized the legislative goal of deterring sexual harassment by promoting responsible efforts by employers to detect, address, and punish it. Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 764, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 654; Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 805-06, 118 S.Ct. at 2290, 141 L.Ed.2d at 686. As this Court *520construed the LAD in Lehmann, the Supreme Court held that the \\u201c \\u2018primary objective\\u2019 \\u201d of Title VII was \\u201cnot to provide redress but to avoid harm.\\u201d Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 805-06,118 S.Ct. at 2292.141 L.Ed.2d at 688 (quoting Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2371, 45 L.Ed.2d 280, 296 (1975)); see also Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 625-26, 626 A.2d 445. The Court noted in Faragher, supra, the advice of the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to employers to \\u201c\\u2018take all steps necessary to prevent sexual harassment from occurring, such as ... informing employees of their right to raise and how to raise the issue of harassment.\\u2019 \\u201d 524 US. at 806, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688 (quoting 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1604.11(f) (1997)); see also Ellerth, 524 U.S. at 764, 118 S.Ct at 2270.141 L.Ed.2d at 654. Given the clear objective of Title VII to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace, the Supreme Court arrived at the conclusion that was reached by this Court in Lehmann, Cavuoti and Gaines: the imposition of strict liability on an employer when it has taken no tangible employment action against the plaintiff employee, without respect to that employer\\u2019s efforts to foster a workplace free from harassment, would contravene the legislative goal of deterrence. Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806,118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; see Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 764, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 654. The Supreme Court observed: It would therefore implement clear statutory policy and complement the Government\\u2019s Title VII enforcement efforts to recognize the employer\\u2019s affirmative obligation to prevent violations and give credit here to employers who make reasonable efforts to discharge their duty. Indeed, a theory of vicarious liability for misuse of supervisory power would be at odds with the statutory policy if it failed to provide employers with some such incentive. Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; see also Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 764,118 S.Ct. at 2270,141 L.Ed,2d at 654. The Supreme Court identified another factor that was central to its analysis. Invoking \\u201cthe general theory of damages,\\u201d the Supreme Court observed that a complainant in a sexual harassment case \\u201chas a duty \\u2018to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages\\u2019 that result *521from violations of Title VII.\\u201d Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. EEOC, 458 U.S. 219, 231 n. 15, 102 S.Ct. 8057, 3065 n. 15, 73 L.Ed.2d 721, 732 n. 15 (1982)). It held that \\u201cif the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the employer\\u2019s preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover damages that could have been avoided if she had done so.\\u201d Id. at 806-07,118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; see also Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655. In Ellerth and Famgher, the Supreme Court thus integrated the agency principles of Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) with the legislative objective of deterring sexual harassment by promoting effective anti-harassment policies. It adopted the following standard: An employer is subject, to vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c). The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2292-93, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; see also Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655.1 The Supreme Court further commented that wlhile proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any ease when litigating the first element of the defense, Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765,118 S.Ct. at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655. We concur with the Supreme Court that the Ellerth/Faragher analysis provides a fair and practical framework for supervisor sexual harassment cases.7 Consistent with the *522focus of Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) on the nexus between the employer\\u2019s delegation of authority and the harassment, the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense may not be asserted \\u201cwhen the supervisor\\u2019s harassment culminates in a tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.\\u201d Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 808, 118 S.Ct. at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. No affirmative defense is available in such cases because \\u201cwhen a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the agency relation____Tangible employment actions are the means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on subordinates.\\u201d Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 761-62,118 S.Ct. at 2269,141 L.Ed.2d at 653-54. In addition, the defense provides no protection to an employer whose sexual harassment policy fails to provide \\u201cmeaningful and effective policies and procedures for employees to use in response to harassment.\\u201d Gaines, supra, 173 N.J. at 317, 801 A.2d 322; see also Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 626, 626 A.2d 445 (stating that the LAD requires an \\u201cunequivocal commitment from the top that the employer\\u2019s opposition to sexual harassment is not just words, but backed up by consistent practice\\u201d); accord Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806-07, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. In short, the affirmative defense provides no benefit to employers who empower sexually harassing employees who take tangible employment actions against their victims, em*523ployers who fail to implement effective anti-harassment policies, and employers whose policies exist in name only. Conversely, the Ellerth/Faragher framework motivates employers and employees to accomplish the paramount objective identified by this Court in Lehmann: the prevention of sexual harassment. See Lehmann, supra, 182 N.J. at 625-26, 626 A.2d 445. The prospect of an affirmative defense in litigation is a powerful incentive for an employer to unequivocally warn its workforce that sexual harassment will not be tolerated, to provide consistent training, and to strictly enforce its policy. See ibid.; accord Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806-07, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 764-65, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. The Ellerth/Faragher defense similarly motivates a complainant in a sexual harassment case to report the offense internally, and thereby enable his or her employer to take immediate action against a harassing supervisor or coworker. In contending that we authorize employers to \\u201chide behind a paper anti-discrimination policy,\\u201d post at 581, 107 A.3d at 1274, and permit defendants to \\u201cseek cover behind an ineffective anti-discrimination policy,\\u201d post at 533,107 A.3d at 1274, our dissenting colleagues\\u2019 rhetoric fundamentally mischaracterizes our decision. So that the dissent\\u2019s description of our opinion does not confuse employers, employees, counsel or trial courts with respect to this pivotal issue, we restate: an employer that implements an ineffective anti-harassment policy, or fails to enforce its policy, may not assert the affirmative defense. See Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 806-07, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 764-65,118 S.Ct. at 2270,141 L.Ed.2d at 655. Accordingly, we expressly adopt the Ellerth/Faragher analysis for supervisor sexual harassment cases in which a hostile work environment is claimed pursuant to the LAD, and no tangible employment action is taken. See Entrot v. BASF Corp., 359 N.J.Super. 162, 187, 819 A.2d 447 (App.Div.2003) (anticipating adoption of Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, and holding that *524\\u201cthere is no barrier to the application of a Title VII defense based on Ellerth/Faragher to an LAD action\\u201d).8 In a hostile work environment sexual harassment case under the LAD in which the plaintiff alleges employer vicarious liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), the plaintiff has the initial burden of presenting a prima facie hostile work environment claim. If no tangible employment action has been taken against the plaintiff, the defendant employer may assert the two-pronged affirmative defense of Ellerth and Faragher. To establish that defense, the defendant employer has the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, both prongs of the affirmative defense: first, that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and to correct promptly sexually harassing behavior; and second, that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to otherwise avoid harm. See Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2293, 141 L.Ed.2d at 689; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 746, 118 S.Ct. at 2262, 141 L.Ed.2d at 644. The employee may rebut the elements of the affirmative defense. Thus, in further proceedings in this case, including any summary judgment proceedings that may follow remand, the State may avoid vicarious liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) by demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the DOC *525exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and that Aguas unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the DOC, or to avoid harm otherwise. See Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. at 2292, 141 L.Ed.2d at 688; Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. at 2270, 141 L.Ed.2d at 655. V. The second issue raised in this case, the definition of a supervisor for purposes of claims based on sexual harassment giving rise to a hostile work environment, is a pivotal factor in the application of the agency principles set forth in Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). Liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) predicated on a supervisor\\u2019s misconduct raises a critical question of fact\\u2014the parameters of the authority conferred on the alleged harasser and whether he or she is properly considered a supervisor. See Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). The Court in Lehmann did not expressly define \\u201csupervisor\\u201d for purposes of deciding vicarious liability sexual harassment cases under agency law. It alluded, however, to the \\u201cpower delegated to a supervisor to control the day-to-day working environment.\\u201d Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 620, 626 A.2d 445. Further, in the context of its discussion of punitive damages, the Court distinguished between a \\u201csupervisor\\u201d and the employer\\u2019s \\u201cupper management.\\u201d let. at 622-23, 626 A.2d 445. The Court thus suggested that its concept of a supervisor, for purposes of the agency analysis that it proposed, included a broader range of managers than the senior executives who set policy for an employer. Id. at 623, 626 A.2d 445. Similarly, in Cavuoti, supra, in which the definition of \\u201cupper management\\u201d for purposes of a claim for punitive damages was the primary issue, the Court cited federal authority for the principle that it is an alleged harasser\\u2019s functional authority in the workplace, not simply his or her power to hire and terminate a *526subordinate, that defines his or her status as a \\u201csupervisor.\\u201d 161 N.J. at 124-25, 735 A.2d 548. In its role as the agency charged with the enforcement of Title VII, the EEOC provided guidance to employers regarding the meaning of the term \\u201csupervisor\\u201d for purposes of sexual harassment eases. U.S. Equal Emp\\u2019t Opportunity Comm\\u2019n, No. 915.002 Enforcement Guidance on Vicarious Liability for Unlawful Harassment by Supervisors 3-5 (June 18, 1999) hereinafter \\u201cEEOC Guidance\\u201d, available at http://www.eeoe.gov/policy/docs/ harassmentpdf. Applying the Ellerth/Faragher analysis, the EEOC cautioned that the determination of whether an alleged harasser is a \\u201csupervisor\\u201d turns on job function, not job title, that it \\u201cmust be based on the specific facts,\\u201d and that a supervisor\\u2019s authority \\u201cmust be of sufficient magnitude so as to assist the harasser explicitly or implicitly in carrying out the harassment.\\u201d Id. at 4. The first of the two definitions of \\u201csupervisor\\u201d promulgated by the EEOC focuses on the supervisor\\u2019s capacity to undertake the adverse employment decisions that, if made, bar an employer from invoking the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense. Under that definition, \\u201can individual qualifies as an employee\\u2019s \\u2018supervisor\\u2019 if he or she is authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting the employee.\\u201d Ibid. The EEOC Guidance defines \\u201ctangible employment decisions\\u201d to include, but not to be limited to, \\u201chiring and firing, promotion and failure to promote, demotion, undesirable reassignment, a decision causing a significant change in benefits, compensation decisions and work assignment,\\u201d and \\u201csuspension\\u201d or other \\u201cprogressive discipline.\\u201d Id. at 4, 6-7 n. 31. The EEOC explained: An individual whose job responsibilities include the authority to recommend tangible job decisions affecting an employee qualifies as his or her supervisor even if the individual does not have the final say. As the Supreme Court recognized in Ellerth, a tangible employment decision \\u201cmay be subject to review by higher level supervisors.\\u201d As long as the individual\\u2019s recommendation is given substantial weight by the final decision maker(s), that individual meets the definition of supervisor. /d at 4 (footnote omitted). *527The EEOC\\u2019s second definition of \\u201csupervisor\\u201d reflects the language of the second clause in Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), which requires that the sexual harasser be \\u201caided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\\u201d Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). Citing the lifeguard supervisor setting of Faragher, the EEOC deems \\u201can individual who is authorized to direct another employee\\u2019s day-to-day work activities\\u201d as a supervisor, \\u201ceven if that individual does not have the authority to undertake or recommend tangible job decisions.\\u201d EEOC Guidance, supra, at 4. The EEOC stated: An individual who is temporarily authorized to direct another employee\\u2019s daily-work activities qualifies as his or her \\u201csupervisor\\u201d during that time period. Accordingly, the employer would be subject to vicarious liability if that individual commits unlawful harassment of a subordinate while serving as his or her supervisor. On the other hand, someone who merely relays other officials\\u2019 instructions regarding work assignments and reports back to those officials does not have true supervisory authority. Furthermore, someone who directs only a limited number of tasks or assignments would not qualify as a \\u201csupervisor.\\u201d For example, an individual whose delegated authority is confined to coordinating a work project of limited scope is not a supervisor. Id. at 5.J In Vance v. Ball State University, \\u2014 U.S.-,-, 133 S.Ct. 2434, 2443,186 L.Ed.2d 565 (2013), a closely divided United States Supreme Court adopted a substantially narrower definition of \\u201csupervisor\\u201d than that of the EEOC for purposes of employer vicarious liability in supervisor sexual harassment cases. There, the majority construed Ellerth and Faragher to envision not two definitions of the term \\u201csupervisor,\\u201d but \\u201ca unitary category of supervisors, i.e., those employees with the authority to make tangible employment decisions.\\u201d Ibid. It held: An employer may be vicariously liable for an employee\\u2019s unlawful harassment only when the employer has empowered that employee to take tangible employment actions against the victim, i.e., to effect a \\u201csignificant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\\u201d Ibid, (quoting Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 7(11, 118 S.Ct. at 2257, 141 L.E.2d at 633). *528We decline to adopt the restrictive definition of \\u201csupervisor\\u201d prescribed by the Supreme Court majority in Vance. In light of our fact-specific approach to sexual harassment cases, we respectfully disagree with the Supreme Court\\u2019s rejection of the EEOC\\u2019s definition of supervisor on the grounds that it relies \\u201con a highly case-specific evaluation of numerous factors.\\u201d Ibid. We agree with the EEOC that the term \\u201csupervisor,\\u201d defined more expansively to include not only employees granted the authority to make tangible employment decisions, but also those placed in charge of the complainant\\u2019s daily work activities, accurately reflects the two different settings envisioned by Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). Moreover, this broader definition comports with this Court\\u2019s holding in Lehmann, in which the Court recognized the importance, in Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d) sexual harassment cases, of a supervisor\\u2019s authority to control the day-to-day working environment. Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 620, 626 A.2d 445. It is also consistent with the holding in Cavuoti in which the Court rejected the notion that only the power to hire and terminate a subordinate distinguishes a supervisor from a co-employee. Cavuoti supra, 161 N.J. at 124-25, 735 A.2d 548. The EEOC definition takes into account the broad range of employer structures and factual settings in which sexual harassment occurs. Most importantly, the more expansive definition of \\u201csupervisor\\u201d furthers the paramount goal of the LAD: the eradication of sexual harassment in the workplace. It prompts employers to focus attention not only on an elite group of decision-makers at the pinnacle of the organization, but on all employees granted the authority to direct the day-to-day responsibilities of subordinates, and to ensure that those employees are carefully selected and thoroughly trained. In any additional proceedings in this ease following remand, the question of whether McClish or Hill served as Aguas\\u2019s \\u201csupervisor\\u201d should be determined in accordance with the two definitions set forth by the EEOC. Under that standard, the allegedly harassing employee should be considered a supervisor *529for purposes of Aguas\\u2019s hostile work environment claim if either: (1) he was authorized to undertake tangible employment decisions affecting Aguas; or (2) he was authorized by the DOC to direct her day-to-day work activities at Edna Mahan. VI. Finally, we consider Aguas\\u2019s claim for punitive damages. The trial court premised its dismissal of Aguas\\u2019s punitive damages claim on its determination that the record supported no claim for compensatory damages in this case and accordingly did not undertake a detailed analysis of the punitive damages claim. We briefly review the standard that governs such a claim. A plaintiff asserting a punitive damages claim in a LAD case against a public entity such as the DOC must meet a high standard. A public sector employer \\u201cwhose egregious conduct violates the LAD may be held \\u2018liable for punitive damages ... only in the event of actual participation by upper management or willful indifference.\\u2019 \\u201d Lockley v. Dep\\u2019t of Corr., 177 N.J. 413, 424, 828 A.2d 869 (2003) (quoting Cavuoti supra, 161 N.J. at 117, 735 A.2d 548). The plaintiff must prove egregious conduct on the part of the defendant by clear and convincing evidence. Id. at 432, 828 A.2d 869 (citing L. 1995, c. 142, \\u00a7 11); see also Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 624-25, 626 A.2d 445 (quoting Leimgruber v. Claridge Assocs., 73 N.J. 450, 454, 375 A.2d 652 (1977)). For such damages, \\u201ca higher level of culpability than mere negligence\\u201d is required. Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 626, 626 A.2d 445. For purposes of this analysis, defining the employer\\u2019s \\u201cupper management\\u201d is a fact-sensitive inquiry that does not \\u201cdepend\\u00ed on labels or titles but on whether an employee possesses \\u2018significant power, discretion and influence.\\u2019 \\u201d Lockley, supra, 177 N.J. at 424, 828 A.2d 869 (quoting Cavuoti, supra, 161 N.J. at 123, 735 A.2d 548). This Court has explained that upper management would consist of those responsible to formulate the organization\\u2019s anti-discrimination policies, provide compliance programs and insist on performance (its governing body, its executive officers), and those to whom the *530organization has delegated the responsibility to execute its policies in the workplace, who set the atmosphere or control the day-to-day operations of the unit (such as heads of departments, regional managers, or compliance officers). For an employee on the second tier of management to be considered a member of \\u201cupper management,\\u201d the employee should have either (1) broad supervisory powers over the involved employees, including the power to hire, fire, promote, and discipline, or (2) the delegated responsibility to execute the employer\\u2019s policies to ensure a safe, productive and discrimination-free workplace. Obviously such instructions should be tailored to the facts of the case and might be accompanied by special interrogatories when several officers are presented as members of \\u201cupper management.\\u201d Cavuoti supra, 161 N.J. at 128-29, 735 A.2d 548. Thus, this fact-sensitive inquiry requires consideration of the following: (1) the employee\\u2019s position in the employer\\u2019s hierarchy; (2) the employee\\u2019s function and responsibilities; and (3) the amount of discretion the employee exercises. Lockley, supra, 177 N.J. at 424, 828 A.2d 869. Although claims brought pursuant to the LAD are excluded from the statutory cap set by the Punitive Damages Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.9 to -5.17 (PDA), in N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.14, the PDA\\u2019s \\u201cgeneral requirements for procedural and substantive fairness are mandated.\\u201d Baker v. Nat\\u2019l State Bank, 161 N.J. 220, 229, 736 A.2d 462 (1999). Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(c), if the trier of fact determines that an award is appropriate in an LAD case against a public sector employer, it sets the amount of that award by considering all relevant evidence relating to the factors set forth in N.J.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(b), \\u201cthe profitability of the misconduct to the defendant\\u201d and when the misconduct was terminated.9 Consequently, if the trial court is called upon to determine Aguas\\u2019s punitive damages claim on remand, it should assess whether Aguas has shown by clear and convincing evidence that the DOC committed \\u201cegregious conduct,\\u201d and if so, whether she *531has presented clear and convincing evidence that \\u201cupper management\\u201d either participated directly in sexual harassment, or showed \\u201cwillful indifference.\\u201d The court should also assess Aguas\\u2019s claims in accordance with the PDA and this Court\\u2019s holdings in Cavuoti and Lockley. Yu The judgment of the Appellate Division is reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. N.J.A.C. 4A:7-3.1 generally sets forth the States policy prohibiting hostile work environment harassment and other forms of discrimination in the workplace. The State policy governs all State employees and all employment practices, and mandates that every State agency implement procedures for internal complaints of harassment. NJ.A.C. 4A:7-3.1(a), (g). The DOC policy then in effect required officers to pass through a metal detector before entering the facility, and provided that if an individual failed to clear the metal detector after four attempts, security would be notified and the officer would be pat-frisked by another officer of the same gender. In a decision that was not appealed, the trial court also dismissed Aguass retaliation claim. The Court \\u201chas frequently looked to federal precedent governing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 2000e to \\u00a7 2000e-17 (Title VII\\u2019), as a key source of interpretive authority. \\u201d Id. at 600 (quoting Grigoletti v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., 118 N.J. 89, 97, 570 A.2d 903 (1990)); see also Quinlan v. Curtiss-Wright Corp., 204 N.J. 239, 261-63, 8 A.3d 209 (2010). That rule is not absolute; this Court has declined to follow federal law when that law sharply diverges from prior authority construing the LAD. See, e.g., Alexander v. Seton Hall Univ., 204 N.J. 219, 232-35, 8 A.3d 198 (2010) (declining to follow United States Supreme Court\\u2019s approach to wage discrimination claims in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 127 S.Ct. 2162, 167 L.Ed.2d 982 (2007), in light of \\\"settled prior case law\\u201d contrary to the Supreme Court\\u2019s holding.) Thus, we evaluate the analysis adopted by federal courts construing Title VII to determine whether that analysis furthers the objectives of the LAD and comports with our prior holdings. Our dissenting colleagues argue that Model Jury Charge (Civil) 2.25 demonstrates that New Jersey law rejects an affirmative defense in a supervisory sexual harassment claim against an employer. Post at 533-35, 107 A.3d at 1275-76. Following Lehmann, this Court has never addressed the jury charge that should be given in a supervisory sexual harassment case. If, as the dissent suggests, the Model Jury Charge endorses a strict liability test in cases such as this, then the charge is inconsistent with I^ehmann, Cavuoti and Gaines. See Lehmann, supra, 132 N.J. at 617-20, 626 A.2d 445; Gaines, supra, 173 N.J. at 314, 801 A.2d 322; Cavuoti, supra, 161 N.J. at 120-21, 735 A.2d 548. In fact, the jury charge cited by the dissent derives from the I^ehmann Court\\u2019s adoption of the inquiry set forth in Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d): whether the supervisor \\u201cpurported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was reliance upon apparent authority, or was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation.\\u201d Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). The Ellerth/Faragher affirmative defense, which directly addresses that question, should be included in our Model Charge. In Ellerth, an employee alleged that she was subjected to sexual harassment by a vice president of the company that employed her. Ellerth, supra, 524 U.S. at 747, 118 S.Ct. at 2262, 141 L.Ed.2d at 644. In Faragher, a lifeguard sued the municipality for which she worked, alleging that her immediate supervisors sexually harassed her. Faragher, supra, 524 U.S. at 780-81, 118 S.Ct. at 2280, 141 L.Ed.2d at 672. Relying on a selection o\\u00ed academic commentary disapproving the EUerth/Faragher analysis, our dissenting colleagues ignore the many state appellate courts that have found the affirmative defense to provide an equitable and workable *522framework for supervisor sexual harassment claims based on a hostile work environment. Post at 538-42, 107 4.3d at 1278-80, see, e.g., Bank One v. Murphy, 52 S.W.3d 540 (Ky.2001); Frieler v. Carlson Mktg. Grp., 751 N.W.2d 558 (Minn.2008); Parker v. Warren County Util. Dist., 2 S.W.3d 170 (Tenn.1999); Waffle House, Inc. v. Williams, 313 S.W.3d 796 (Tex.2010); Brittell v. Dep\\u2019t of Corr., 247 Conn. 148, 717 A.2d 1254 (1998); Natson v. Eckerd Corp., Inc., 885 So.2d 945 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 4th Dist.2004); Sangster v. Albertsons, Inc., 99 Wash.App. 156, 991 P.2d 674 (2000). The Appellate Division opinion on which our dissenting colleagues rely, Schmidt v. Smith, 294 N.J.Super. 569, 684 A.2d 66 (App.Div.1996), affd, 155 N.J. 44, 713 A.2d 1014 (1998), is not to the contrary. Post at 533-34, 107 A.3d at 1275. In its brief review of claims of direct liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(b) and vicarious liability under Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d), the Appellate Division simply summarized portions of this Court\\u2019s discussion of these claims in Lehmann. See Schmidt, supra, 294 N.J.Super. at 578-79, 684 A.2d 66. Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, the Appellate Division neither stated nor implied that Lehmann precludes the assertion of an affirmative defense to a claim of vicarious liability based on Restatement \\u00a7 219(2)(d). Ibid. Although the dissent contends that the Appellate Division \\\"pointed out that unlike supervisory liability,\\u201d negligence claims permit an employer to present evidence of its due care giving rise to a defense, post at 533-34, 107 A.3d at 1275, such a distinction is nowhere to be found in Schmidt. See Schmidt, supra, 294 N.J.Super. at 578-79, 684 A.2d 66. A fourth factor identified in NJ.S.A. 2A:15-5.12(c), the defendants financial condition, is generally not considered when the defendant is a public entity because it \\\"does not further the goal of deterrence as it does in the private sector.\\\" Lockley, supra, 177 N.J. at 430-31, 828 A.2d 869.\",\n          \"parties: Alyce T.

            "OPINION ALICE M. BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. Alyce Conlon worked at InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (“IVCF”) in Michigan as a spiritual director, involved in providing religious counsel and prayer. She informed IVCF that she was contemplating divorce, at which point IVCF put her on paid — and later unpaid — leave. When her marital situation continued to worsen despite counseling efforts, IVCF terminated her employment. Conlon sued IVCF and her supervisors in federal district court under Title VII and Michigan law. IVCF claimed the First Amendment’s ministerial exception to employment laws. The court dismissed the case, holding the ministerial exception bars all of Conlon’s claims. We AFFIRM. I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA (“IVCF”) is “an evangelical campus mission serving students and faculty on college and university campuses nationwide,” whose “vision is to see students and faculty transformed, campuses renewed and world changers developed.” IVCF’s purpose “is to establish and advance at colleges and universities witnessing communities of students and faculty who follow Jesus as Savior and Lord: growing in love for God, God’s Word, God’s people of every ethnicity and culture and God’s purposes in the world.” IVCF “believes in the sanctity of marriage and desires that all married employees honor their marriage vows.” It is part of IVCF’s policy that “wjhere there are significant marital issues, IVCF encourages employees to seek appropriate help to move towards reconciliation” and IVCF reserves the right “to consider the impact of any separation/divoree on colleagues, students, faculty, and donors.” IVCF’s website includes the following regarding employment opportunities: InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA is both an equal opportunity employer and a faith-based religious organization. We conduct hiring without regard to race, color, ancestry, national origin, citizenship, age, sex, marital status, parental status, membership in any labor organization, political ideology, or disability of an otherwise qualified individual. The status of IVCF as an Equal Opportunity Employer does not prevent the organization from hiring staff based on their religious beliefs so that all staff share the same religious commitment. www.intervarsity.org/jobs (last visited Jan. 9, 2015). The website states that all employees must annually reaffirm their agreement with IVCF’s Purpose Statement and Doctrinal Basis. The website includes: “Pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 702 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-l(a)), IVCF has the right to, and does, hire only candidates who agree with IVCF’s Statement of Agreement: Purpose and Doctrinal Basis.” *832Alyce T. Conlon began working for IVCF in 1986. In 1988, Conlon married David Roy Reimer. From 2004 to 2011, Conlon was a “spiritual director” or “Spiritual Formation Specialist” for IVCF staff members, and obtained a certification in Spiritual Direction. Her duties included assisting others to cultivate “intimacy with God and growth in Christ-like character through personal and corporate spiritual disciplines.” In March of 2011, Conlon and her husband were considering divorce, and, as required by IVCF policy, she informed her supervisor of the situation. At that time, and until May 2011, Defendant Marc Papai was Conlon’s supervisor. Defendant Fred Bailey was her acting supervisor from May 2011 until her termination. Papai put Conlon on paid leave to attempt to repair her marriage, as authorized by IVCF policy. Both Papai and Bailey were actively involved with this effort. According to the complaint, Conlon’s repeated requests to return to work were denied. Conlon also claims that in an email dated September 12, 2011, “Bailey stated knowing falsehoods to several individuals that Plaintiff did not make efforts to reconcile her marriage and put her on unpaid leave.” IVCF terminated Conlon on December 20, 2011, which Conlon alleges was for “failing to reconcile her marriage.” At that time Conlon was still married to Reimer. Conlon claims that two or more similarly situated male employees divorced their spouses during their employment, but were not disciplined or terminated. In January 2012, Reimer filed for divorce against Conlon. Shortly after her termination, Conlon filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) and the Michigan Department of Civil Rights. On or about July 17, 2013, EEOC gave Conlon a right to sue letter that also informed her that EEOC would not be filing suit. Conlon filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 8, 2013, and filed an amended complaint on December 19, 2013, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified at 42 U.S.C. § 2000e el seq., for gender discrimination, and of Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Act, Mich. Comp. Laws § 37.2101 et seq. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on January 9, 2014, asserting the ministerial exception as an affirmative defense. The district court granted the motion on April 3, 2014, and this timely appeal followed. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW We review de novo “a district court’s order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6),” construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accepting all factual allegations as true. Mik v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 743 F.3d 149, 156-57 (6th Cir.2014). III. ANALYSIS This is the first opportunity since the Supreme Court’s decision in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church &amp; School v. EEOC, — U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 694, 181 L.Ed.2d 650 (2012), for this court to address the “ministerial exception.” That case — and our decision in Hollins v. Methodist Healthcare, Inc., 474 F.3d 223 (6th Cir.2007), insofar as Hollins is consistent with it — informs our analysis here. In Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court examined the ministerial exception, first, in the context of the Framers’ historical concerns in crafting the Establishment Clause, such as English laws under which the English monarch became the head of the national church and wielded authority to appoint its ministers. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702 (citing Supremacy Act of *8331534, 26 Hen. 8, ch. 1; Act in Restraint of Annates, 25 Hen. 8, ch. 20 (1534)). The Court then reviewed similar laws and practices in America’s colonial history and the early years after the Constitution was adopted. See id. at 703-04. “It was against this background that the First Amendment was adopted. Familiar with life under the established Church of England, the founding generation sought to foreclose the possibility of a national church.” Id. at 703. After reviewing its own jurisprudence regarding governmental interference in churches’ selection of clergy and resolution of disputes over church properties, id. at 704-05, the Supreme Court turned to the question of whether “this freedom of a religious organization to select its ministers is implicated by a suit alleging discrimination in employment,” id. at 705. The Court explicitly agreed with the many courts of appeals that had long recognized “the existence of a ‘ministerial exception,’ grounded in the First Amendment, that precludes application of Title VII and other employment discrimination laws to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers.” Id. The ministerial exception is an affirmative defense that plaintiffs should first assert in a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Id. at 709 n. 4.1 And in Hollins, we said that “in order for the ministerial exception to bar an employment discrimination claim, the employer must be a religious institution and the employee must have been a ministerial employee.” Hollins, 474 F.3d at 225. A. The parties agree that the ministerial exception would typically apply to federal employment-law claims. The dispute arises because Conlon claims IVCF waived the exception. However, whether the exception attaches at all is a pure question of law which this court must determine for itself. So before considering waiver, we must consider whether the ministerial exception would otherwise apply to these facts. The Supreme Court in HosannarTabor framed the issue in a religious-employment lawsuit as “whether the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar such an action when the employer is a religious group and the employee is one of the group’s ministers.” Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 699. The two Religion Clauses “often exert conflicting pressures,” Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 719, 125 S.Ct. 2113, 161 L.Ed.2d 1020 (2005), such that there can often be “internal tension ... between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause,” Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 677, 91 S.Ct. 2091, 29 L.Ed.2d 790 (1971) (plurality opinion). “Not so here. Both Religion Clauses bar the government from interfering with the decision of a religious group to fire one of its ministers.” Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702. “The Establishment Clause prevents the Government from appointing ministers, and the Free Exercise Clause prevents it from interfering with the freedom of religious groups to select their own.” Id. at 703. B. Unlike the defendant in Hosanna-Tabor, IVCF is not a church. So we must first determine whether IVCF is an organization that can assert the ministerial exception. We conclude that IVCF can claim this protection. It is undisputed *834that InterVarsity Christian Fellowship is a Christian organization, whose purpose is to advance the understanding and practice of Christianity in colleges and universities. It is therefore a “religious group” under Hosannar-Tabor. Indeed, we have previously held that a Methodist hospital is “a clearly religious organization” for First Amendment purposes. Hollins, 474 F.3d at 224. Although the church in Hosanna-Tabor was part of the Missouri Synod denomination within Lutheranism, and the hospital in Hollins was specifically United Methodist within Methodisny, the ministerial exception’s applicability does not turn on its being tied to a specific denominational faith; it applies to multidenominational and nondenominational religious organizations as well. As we held in Hollins, “in order to invoke the exception, an employer need not be a traditional religious organization such as a church, diocese, or synagogue, or an entity, operated by a traditional religious organization.” Id. at 225. “A religiously affiliated entity” is one whose “mission is marked by clear or obvious religious characteristics.” Shaliehsabou v. Hebrew Home of Greater Wash., Inc., 363 F.3d 299, 310 (4th Cir.2004) (applying the ministerial exception to a Jewish nursing home). That is clearly the case for IVCF, with not only its Christian name, but its mission of Christian ministry and teaching. We must also determine whether the ministerial exception protects against the claim at issue here. Both of the cases directly on point, Hosanna-Tabor and Hollins, involved plaintiffs raising claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. (“ADA”). Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 701; Hollins, 474 F.3d at 224, 227. But in Hosanna-Tabor, the Supreme Court framed the issue as whether there is a ministerial exception that precludes the application of “Title VII ... and other employment discrimination laws” to claims of discrimination against a religious institution by its ministers, and held that there is. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 705. So we must consider whether the ministerial exception applies to Conlon’s sex-discrimination claim, which absent the exception would be a facially plausible claim under Title VII. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(l). In Hosanna-Tabor, the Court addressed a Lutheran church school’s decision to terminate Cheryl Perich, a teacher and “commissioned minister” who the school believed was not able to perform her duties because of a disability. See Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 705-08. The Court held that the ministerial exception precluded the courts from entertaining claims that Perich’s employment had been terminated because of her disability or in retaliation for her filing a complaint with the EEOC alleging disability discrimination. Though the Court did not “adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister,” id. at 707, the Court identified four factors that led it to conclude Perich was a minister covered by the exception: “1 the formal title given Perich by the Church, 2 the substance reflected in that title, 3 her own use of that title, and 4 the important religious functions she performed for the Church,” id. at 708. We examine those factors here. First, the formal title. Unlike Perich, Conlon does not have the title of “minister.” Her briefs describe her as a “spiritual director,” and IVCF’s brief refers to her as a “Spiritual Formation Specialist.” We hold that either title is sufficient. “Pastor,” “reverend,” “priest,” “bishop,” or “rabbi” are clearly religious leadership titles no different from “minister.” Beyond that, courts need only determine whether the wording of the title conveys a religious — as opposed to secular— *835meaning. The word “spiritual” is such an identifying term. Second, the substance reflected in the title “Spiritual Formation Specialist” or “spiritual director.” The Hosanna-Tabor Court noted the formal seminary training that Perich received in theology, and the multi-step process whereby she was invested as a “commissioned minister.” Id. at 699. Her title “reflected a significant degree of religious training followed by a formal process of commissioning.” Id. at 707. While IVCF points out that Conlon earned a certification in “spiritual direction,” we are not provided with any details to justify comparing this to the rigorous requirements Perich satisfied to earn her ministerial title, ones that clearly set her apart from laypersons. Therefore we conclude that factor has not been demonstrated here. Third, Conlon’s use of the ministerial title. The Court suggested that Perich’s position as a school teacher interacting with students and parents, and occasional worship leader in large chapel assemblies, was a form of holding herself out to the public as a minister of the Lutheran Chureh-Missouri Synod. See id. at 705-OS. Here, however, nothing in the pleadings suggests that Conlon had the sort of public role of interacting with the community as an ambassador of the faith that rises to the level of Perich’s leadership role within her church, school, and community. Therefore this factor is not present, either. Fourth, the important religious functions Conlon performed for the religious organization. Most of Perich’s -work was secular in nature, id. at 708, but included “leading others toward Christian maturity” and “teaching faithfully the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in,its truth and purity.” App. 48, quoted in Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 708. Here, part of Conlon’s duties was to assist others to cultivate “intimacy with God and growth in Christ-like character through personal and corporate spiritual disciplines.” That is a ministerial function, and so we hold the fourth factor is satisfied. Two of the four Hosanna-Tabor factors are clearly present in Conlon’s former position. The Court expressly declined to rule upon whether the exception would apply in the absence of one or more of those factors. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 708. Justice Thomas’s concurring opinion in Hosanna-Tabor looks solely to a broad reading of the first factor, positing that whenever a religious employer identifies an individual as a minister, courts should “defer to a religious organization’s good-faith understanding of who qualifies as its minister.” Id. at 710 (Thomas, J., concurring). Justice Alito— joined by Justice Kagan — instead posits that the ministerial exception “should apply to any ‘employee’ who 1 leads a religious organization, 2 conducts worship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals, or serves as a messenger or 4 teacher of its faith.” Id. at 712 (Alito, J., concurring). That is essentially a restatement of the fourth factor. We need not decide in this case whether either of those factors alone suffices .to invoke the ministerial exception, but we do hold that where both factors — formal title and religious function — are present, the ministerial exception clearly applies. IVCF may assert the ministerial exception regarding Conlon’s former position. The parties point to no historical example in which the founding generation permitted any arm of the federal government — including the judiciary — to order a religious organization to accept or retain in a ministerial position a person whom the organization deemed unfit for ministry. To the contrary, the historical practice has always been that the government cannot dictate to a religious organization who its *836spiritual leaders would be. “By forbidding the ‘establishment of religion’ and guaranteeing the ‘free exercise thereof,’ the Religion Clauses ensured that the new Federal Government — unlike the English Crown— would have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices.” Id. at 703 (majority opinion). . C. Conlon argues that her claims against IVCF are not barred because IVCF waived the ministerial exception. Conlon is wrong. The ministerial exception is a structural limitation imposed on the government by the Religion Clauses, a limitation that can never be waived. It is true that in Hollins, we held that the ministerial exception can be waived, but only if “the evidence is ‘clear and compelling’ that such rights were waived.” Sambo’s Restaurants, Inc. v. Ann Arbor, 663 F.2d 686, 690 (6th Cir.1981) (quoting Curtis Publ’g Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S. 130, 145, 87 S.Ct. 1975, 18 L.Ed.2d 1094 (1967)), quoted in Hollins, 474 F.3d at 226. But Hosannar-Tabor forecloses such waiver, abrogating that aspect of Hollins. “Both Religion Clauses bar the government from interfering” with a religious organization’s decisions as to who will serve as ministers. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 702 (emphasis added). “The Establishment Clause ... prohibits government involvement in ecclesiastical matters.” Id. at 704 (emphasis added). It is “impermissible for the government to contradict a church’s determination of who can act as its ministers.” Id. (emphasis added). This reasoning-along with other precedents the Court cites, see, e.g., id. (collecting eases)-does not allow for a situation in which a church could explicitly waive this protection. One of our sister circuits reached the same conclusion prior to Hosanna-Tabor. See Tomic v. Catholic Diocese of Peoria, 442 F.3d 1036, 1042 (7th Cir.2006) (holding “the ministerial exception ... is not subject to waiver or estoppel”), abrogated on other grounds by Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. 694. Nor can such a waiver be reconciled with the Supreme Court’s rationale. “Requiring a church to accept or retain an unwanted minister, or punishing a church for failing to do so, intrudes upon more than a mere employment decision. Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church.” Id. at 705 (emphasis added). The Court’s clear language recognizes that the Constitution does not permit private parties to waive the First Amendment’s ministerial exception. This constitutional protection is not only a personal one; it is a structural one that categorically prohibits federal and state governments from becoming involved in religious leadership disputes. D. We turn next to the question of whether the First Amendment’s ministerial exception can be asserted as a defense against state law claims. We hold that it can. First, the ministerial exception is recognized under Michigan law. Weishuhn v. Catholic Diocese of Lansing, 279 Mich.App. 150, 756 N.W.2d 483, 497 (2008) (“The ministerial exception exists in Michigan. This exception bars discrimination claims where religious employers employ or have employed plaintiffs with religious positions.”). But even if it were not, because the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment by incorporation, the federal right would defeat any Michigan statute that, as applied, violates the First Amendment. Indeed, in a footnote, the Supreme Court suggested it approved of the Hosanna-Tabor plaintiffs admission that if the ministerial exception applied in her case regarding federal law, the exception would also bar her claims under Michigan state law. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 709 n. 3 (“Perich does not dispute that if the ministerial exception *837bars her retaliation claim under the ADA, it also bars her retaliation claim under Michigan law.”). Moreover, the Establishment Clause applies with the same force against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 380 U.S. 1, 15, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), as does the Free Exercise Clause, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940). And HosanncuTabor based its holding fashioning the ministerial exception in part on Kedroff v. St. Nicholas Cathedral of Russian Orthodox Church in N.A., 344 U.S. 94, 73 S.Ct. 143, 97 L.Ed. 120 (1952), see Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 704-05, which, although not a ministerial exception case per se, was a case in which the Court held that the First Amendment invalidated the state law at issue, see Kedroff, 344 U.S. at 116-19, 73 S.Ct. 143. Therefore the claims brought under Michigan’s Elliott-Larsen .Act fare no better than those brought under Title VII. See U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2 (Supremacy Clause). E. We turn finally to whether the individual supervisors — Bailey and Papai — can be held liable under Michigan law because they cannot claim the ministerial exception. They cannot be held liable. Nothing in federal court or Michigan court precedent suggests that Bailey and Papai cannot claim the ministerial exception when personally sued for discrimination as the agents of a religious employer. Holding the individual decision maker liable for the very employment decision for which the organization cannot be held liable would vitiate both the purpose and the effect of the ministerial exception. F. Because IVCF is a religious organization and Conlon was a ministerial employee, IVCF’s decision to terminate her employment cannot be challenged under federal or state employment discrimination laws. It matters not whether the plaintiff is claiming a specific violation under Title VII or any other employment discrimination statute. The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses do not permit federal or state courts to adjudicate such matters when the defendant properly asserts the ministerial exception as an affirmative defense. As the Supreme Court concluded: The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important. But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission. When a minister who has been fired sues her church alleging that her termination was discriminatory, the First Amendment has struck the balance for us. The church must be free to choose those who will guide it on its way. Hosanna-Tabor, 132 S.Ct. at 710. IV. CONCLUSION The Religion Clauses’ ministerial exception bars federal and state employment-law claims against all the defendants here. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court. . This abrogated our ruling in Hollins that the ministerial exception deprives a court of subject-matter jurisdiction, Hollins, 474 F.3d at 225, which a plaintiff should raise under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1).\n"
